<h2>Target X</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game? My game is supposed to test your reflexes and see how accurate your mouse movement is, by testing how many targets you can hit before the time runs out.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology? I added custom sprites that I cropped and designed myself. I also added a sound whenever you "shoot" at the target.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it? From this prototype, I learned how to spawn random objects in a scene, add assets to a game, and program in JS using Phaser3. I never knew any of this before, so it was really interesting and fun to learn. The easiest part was adding images to the background, and the hardest part was
spawning the targets randomly on the screen after every hit.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
<li>Bouncing Phaser image: <a href="https://phaser.io/download/logo">Phaser logo</a></li>
<li>Starry Background image: <a href = "https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pinterest.com%2Fpin%2F47287864815193354%2F&psig=AOvVaw0Yd1HZ8jLnnsd_YcqVRnjD&ust=1613098800904000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCJjTsrvr4O4CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAP"> Background Image</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here. I guess those aim trainers out there to practice your FPS aim closely resemble my game. I iterated from DA1. Using feedback gotten from peers and TA, I decided to make this iteration harder to play. I made it so that the targets randomly move around the screen, so it makes the game more challenging and interesting to play.

<li>TargetX Iteration: <a href="https://axe2230.github.io/cs325-game-prototypes/da2/">Iteration on TargetX</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game. Click on the targets as they appear, and try to accurately hit as many as you can before the timer runs out.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used. I used the "Things must only be added as you progress, not removed", because your score only goes up as you progress. It doesn't go lower if you miss shots.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype. In this prototype I used the mouse input with a lot of randomness. The play style is joker, with the genre being shooter.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating? This prototype is evaluating mouse movement and mouse control.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game? I want players to have a fun time playing my game, because it isn't the hardest to learn and is addictive.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
<ul>
<li>The player can click around the screen to fire shots. The goal is to click on the targets that appear on the screen, in which case your score goes up. Once you click on the target, a new target will randomly appear on the screen. You have to keep clicking on these targets accurately to increase your score. There is also a timer which
is going down since the start of the game. Once the timer ends, the game is over, and your stats will be displayed in "Average targets hit per second: "</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game? Being attentive is very important, because your brain will react faster to new targets popping up around the screen. Also having a mouse sensitivity you're comfortable with will help.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension? This game is set in an open field where you are trying to hit the targets that appear in your screen. You are the character controlling the mouse movement and clicks. The tension increases as you keep playing, because the timer is constantly going down, and it forces you to hit more and more targets to get a good score.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach. The target audience can be anyone who is trying to test their mouse movement, reflex, or practicing their aiming skills for shooter games.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play? It takes about 20 seconds to play.
