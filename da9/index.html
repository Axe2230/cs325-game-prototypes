<h2>Spy Fall!</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game? It is a single player explorable genre game where the player is an agent trying to take out all the enemy spies.

CHANGELOG: Added the constraint that the player has to claim trophy after killing all enemies to win. Added teleporters that move the player around the map. And also added walls that prevent player from taking shortcuts around the map.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology? It incorporates physics, keyboard events, score tracking, collision boundaries, and incorporates camera to create a fun to play game. I coded everything from scratch and didn't use any Phaser examples.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it? I learned how to handle collisions on specific boundaries, control camera by following the player, and control physics. The easiest part of the game was adding the background. Figuring out how to set the camera position, and also have the scoreboard follow the player was the hardest part.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
<li>I drew the background by hand.</li>
<li>Clip art was from google images</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
I didn't use any Phaser examples to create my game. I just wanted to create a simple explorable game where the player tries to take out all enemies in a map.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game. Take out all enemy spies, and grab the trophy to win the round.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used. This game was prototyped off my analog assignment.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype. The input was keyboard, the randomness was deterministic, playstyle was competitor, and genre was explorer.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating? This prototype is evaluating game physics and unit collision, along with keyboard input and camera movement.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game? I want players to have an enjoying and competitive experience trying to get the highest score they can by killing all the other spies
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
Control the main character using arrow keys, and try to defeat all the spies to win the trophy.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game? Move around the map first to see where all the enemies are positioned.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?

You're a special agent sent to infiltrate a compound and defeat all enemies that lie there.
<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach. Target audience is anyone who likes explorable genre games or spy games.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play? Play time is around 1 or 2 minutes.
</li>
